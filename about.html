                    Hi
                    <br><br>
                    I'm just your every day computer nerd. I have been working with computers professionally since 1996 (yes I am old). During my career I have consulted for companies ranging from SOHOs (Small Office / Home Office) to large corporations in a handful of countries around the world. I have worked in most areas of IT at some point in time, but I mostly enjoy fun challenges, no matter what the discipline is.
                    <br><br>
                    I started this blog a long time ago because some collegues had requested that I document my process of removing the old virus scanner viri from back in the Windows XP days.
                    <br><br>
                    I don't post all that often, but occasionally I will sit down and write something up. If you have something that you would like for me to post about, feel free to reach out to me at 
                    <a href="mailto:info@gulogulodesu.com">info@gulogulodesu.com</a>
                    <br><br>
                    I hope that you enjoy at least some of the things that I post.
