                    Welcome here!
                    <br>
                    Originally this page was done on Wordpress, but due to security issues with my hosting company, I have opted to just switch to a straight HTML page using GitHub pages.
                    <br>
                    As time goes on, I will update the HTML, add CSS, and maybe.....maybe javascript. But for now, this will be a very basic page that focuses on content, rather than functionality.

                                Teaching about how to break out of VLANs on Cisco switches. While all of the commands and steps are laid out, this is a more intermediate to advanced post about networking.

                                A fun challenge of removing a fake antivirus using only the CLI. This was a challenge from someone curious if it was possible to do it all using the CLI. This would be for more advanced Windows users.

                                A walkthrough of how to remove a fake antivirus without running scans that can take a while to do. This was posted at the height of the fake AV's, and it became far too time consuming to run scans on hundreds of PC's. So this is a way to find and remove the fake AV's. This would be for intemediary Windows users.
